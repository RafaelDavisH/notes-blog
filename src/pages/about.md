<h2 class="text-center">Web Developer & Spanish Translations <br /> Leader  at @freeCodeCamp </h2>

I am a web developer with over three years of experience. I'm leading the Spanish translations initiative, where I oversee a team of dedicated contributors. The translations are focused on freeCodeCamp's core curriculum and top english articles/tutorials.

One key accomplishment was developing an efficient workflow system that utilized Google Forms, Google Sheets, Gmail, and Trello. This system helped smooth with the translation of hundreds of freeCodeCamp's top English tutorials into Spanish. It also, played a important role in onboarding more than 20 world language communities, enabling them to translate the curriculum and tutorials into their respective languages.

As of May 2023, I'm excited to take the challenge of developing a new podcast for freeCodeCamp, exclusively in Spanish. Occasionally, I have helped in creating prototype projects for an updated certification within the core curriculum. This year for the JavaScript updated curriculum I worked on a Music Player app.
