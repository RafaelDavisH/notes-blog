# Digital Notes

This repository is a digital garden where I document my learning journey through notes. The notes will cover various topics such as programming, programming tools, projects I'm working on, and other interests of mine.

The purpose of this repository is not to provide tutorials or courses for others to learn from, but rather to serve as a personal space where I can document my progress and share my thoughts. The notes may be raw and unfinished, and will likely be updated, corrected, and modified as I continue to learn.

In addition to my personal notes, I will also include links to any published articles or translations I create throughout my journey.

Feel free to explore and follow along with my learning journey!
